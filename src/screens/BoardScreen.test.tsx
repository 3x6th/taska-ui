/**
 * The board reads five things and used to show a failure in only one of them.
 * When the project read and the membership read failed — which is exactly what
 * the live gateway does today, TAS-162 — the board still drew: the name fell
 * back to "Project", the key badge vanished, every write control went disabled
 * and drag stopped working, and nothing on screen said why (TAS-163). These
 * tests are about the difference between a board that cannot be written to and
 * a board that will not say whether it can — and about the two ways the first
 * attempt at saying it got the answer wrong.
